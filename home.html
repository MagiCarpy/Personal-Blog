      <p>
      I will post anything that comes to mind on this blog.

      Some topics might include academic related discussions,
      personal health documentation, hypothetical ponderings, 
      concepts explained in an educational manner to benefit
      my own consolidation of the information, and any notable 
      daily occurrences amongst other topics.
