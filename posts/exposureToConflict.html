      Expose Yourself to Conflict

      <p>
      Based on prior observation, anecdotal experiences and reading 
      <i>The Art of Thinking Clearly</i>, the following conclusions 
      can be reasonably made. 
      <br><br>
      It is known that human innovation has been predicated upon the 
      interactions of those with conflicting thought processes and 
      beliefs, specifically: "Competition Breeds Innovation". This 
      observation should be quite obvious so let's breakdown a more 
      nuanced application to the everyday life of an individual: 
      the confirmation bias.
      <br><br>
      The specific reason conflict yields innovation and progress 
      is through mutual "checks" on thought processes between 
      individuals. More often than not, you are unable to control 
      your biases. Similar to how you are incapable of controlling 
      procrastination or unable to watching something that might 
      disprove your already established preconceived beliefs. 
      <br><br>
      Likewise, If you look hard enough for support of something, 
      you will find it. If you look hard enough for a connection 
      between two completely unrelated subjects, you will find it. 
      <br><br>
      The implementation of some sort of trigger is required
      to break free from these loops of logically unsound 
      beliefs.

      <br><br>
      <h3>Solutions</h3>
      
      Just like you would solve procrastination, find a 
      reminder to "jolt" you out of a narrower way of thinking. 
      Train yourself to consciously ask yourself, "Am I honestly 
      considering conflicting information?". 
      <br><br>
      Detach yourself from any preconceived beliefs. Resist handling
      beliefs like a loyal sports enthusiast aligned wholeheartedly 
      to one team. Unless you are a lawyer whose job of defending 
      the defendant is greatly aided in a self-deluded adherrence to 
      a single presumption of intent in defending the defendant, why 
      attach yourself to a belief? Attachment to a faulty line of 
      fixed thinking ultimately harms yourself. Open yourself to
      accepting differing but reasonable beliefs and allow flawed 
      beliefs to be discarded.
      <br><br>
      Exposure to varied opinions, perspectives, and thinking that
      challenges your assumptions is the key to fully realizing the
      potential of the two supplementary solutions above. Merely
      tolerating diverse viewpoints is not enough; actively seek 
      out what might be uncomfortable interactions and surround 
      yourself primarily with: those who think differently than you 
      as well as those who disagree with you.
