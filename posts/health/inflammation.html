      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
      After undergoing a stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) in
      response to a diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), 
      I have had to find methods of balancing the benefits and
      detriments of having a new immune system.
      <br><br>
      The purpose of the stem cell transplant was to replace
      my own, cancerous/faulty, immune system (i.e. the monocyte 
      lineage) with a healthy donor chosen from a Global Bone 
      Marrow Registry (NMDP). In my case, the donor was a German 
      woman who was an 11/12 HLA match with myself. Adequate 
      matching is necessary to prevent extensive Graft vs Host
      Disease (GVHD) but maintain enough of a Graft vs Illness 
      effect so that my cancer would have a lower chance of 
      relapse after the chemotherapy and transplant.
      <br><br>
      Today, almost a year out from this transplant which occurred
      December 5th of 2023, I have been somewhat cursed into dealing 
      with a rather overactive immune system. Some issues of
      this have manifested as a form of lung inflammation, organizing
      pneumonia, and pneumomediastinum. This has resulted in a
      prolonged, prescribed course of prednisone, a potent
      anti-inflammatory. 
      <br><br>
      </p>

      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>
      I have looked into natural, nutritional routes of easing these
      symptoms so that I can potentially wean off any medical grade
      immunosuppresants and anti-inflammatories. 

      A presumably credible source of health information, 
      <a href="https://www.drberg.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Berg</a>, 
      suggests incorporation of tumeric into the diet. Based on multiple
      research papers curcumin in tumeric has been shown to have 
      anti-inflammatory effects on auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid
      arthritis that are compounded when combined with pepper and fats 
      which aid absorption.
